# How to Place a Purchase Order for a Specific NFT

If you have a collectible you'd like to add to your collection, you can initiate a purchase order for that specific NFT. Wait for responses from sellers, and the NFT will be automatically purchased once an offer is accepted.

  <li>Click **Confirm** to submit the order, then go to your wallet to sign and complete the payment.</li>

  <li>Once the purchase order is complete, wait for the seller's response. If they accept your offer, the NFT will be automatically transferred to you as an asset. If the order expires and the seller has not accepted it, the transaction fees will be refunded to the address from which the payment was made.</li>
