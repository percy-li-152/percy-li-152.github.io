# Frequently Asked Questions

## 1.What networks does Goldust currently support?

As the first NFT marketplace on Endless, Goldust will initially focus on the Endless blockchain network, providing comprehensive functionality support for its NFT ecosystem. In the future, we will gradually integrate other networks to achieve seamless multi-network collaboration and build a one-stop NFT platform.


## 2.How to Buy and Sell on Goldust

- **Buying**
    - **Direct Purchase**:You can purchase any NFT listed for sale at the stated price and instantly acquire the NFT.

    - **Offer to Buy**:If the listed price of an NFT you desire does not meet your expectations or if the NFT is not currently for sale, you can place an offer on it. If the owner accepts your offer within a specified timeframe (1 day, 3 days, or a custom duration), you will acquire the NFT. Additionally, you can place a bulk offer on an entire collection, and as long as someone accepts your offer, you will automatically receive multiple NFTs.

- **Selling**
    - **Listing for Sale**: You can list your NFT for sale by setting an asking price and an expiration time. If a buyer purchases your NFT before the expiration time, you will receive the sale proceeds. If no one buys the NFT before the expiration time, the listing will be canceled.
