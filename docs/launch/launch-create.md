4. Choose the type of collection.

    **Sequential Minting:** All NFTs use the same image and are minted and displayed in order.

   **Random Minting:** Upload N images along with their supply quantities; the NFTs will be minted randomly.

6. Set the stages of the launch.

   You can set the stages according to your own launch plan:

- **Stage Name:** Currently includes Whitelist Stage, Presale Page, and Public Sale Stage
- **NFT Price for This Stage:** You can set it as free minting, in which case the Gas fee will be paid by the creator; or set a limited price for minting
