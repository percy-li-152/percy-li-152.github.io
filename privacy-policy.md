If you are a resident of the UK, European Union, or EEA, you may have certain data protection rights. **“GDPR”** means the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679, and the United Kingdom Data Protection Act 2018. Information that you provide may be transferred or accessed by entities around the world as described in this Privacy Policy. If you are located in the EEA or UK, you freely consent to the transfer of personal information outside of the EEA and UK. Your consent to this Privacy Policy together with your submission of personal information constitute your agreement to these transfers.

**Data Controller.** For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, Goldust is the Data Controller of your personal information.

**Legal Basis.** Our legal bases for processing your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy are listed below:

- Contractual Necessity: When needed to perform a contract, we are about to enter into or have entered into with you.

- Legitimate Interests: Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests. This may specifically involve research and development, direct marketing, personalizing your user experience, or creating aggregated, de-identified and/or anonymized data.

- Compliance with Law: Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.

- Consent: Where we have your specific consent to carry out the processing for the purpose in question.

**Rights of EEA and UK Residents.** If you are accessing or using the Services from within the EEA or UK, you may have the following rights under the GDPR (as well as other rights). If you wish to exercise any of these rights, you may do so by contacting us as provided in this Privacy Policy.

- Right of Access: You have the right to obtain confirmation from us as to whether or not we process personal information from you and you also have the right to at any time obtain access to your personal information stored by us.

- Right to Correction of your Personal Information: If we process your personal information, we use reasonable measures to ensure that your personal information is accurate and up-to-date for the purposes for which your personal information was collected.

Many of our service providers, advisers, partners or other recipients of data are also based outside the EEA and U.K. This means that, if you use our Services, your personal information will necessarily be accessed and processed outside of the EEA and U.K.

Where we share your personal information with third parties who are based outside Europe, we try to ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by making sure one of the following mechanisms is implemented:

- Transfers to territories with an adequacy decision. We may transfer your personal information to countries or territories whose laws have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal information by the European Commission or UK Government (as and where applicable) (from time to time).
- Transfers to territories without an adequacy decision.
    - We may transfer your personal information to countries or territories whose laws have not been deemed to provide such an adequate level of protection.

    - However, in these cases:

    - we may use specific appropriate safeguards, which are designed to give personal information effectively the same protection it has in Europe – for example, standard-form contracts approved by relevant authorize for this purpose; or

    - in limited circumstances, we may rely on an exception, or ‘derogation’, which permits us to transfer your personal information to such country despite the absence of an ‘adequacy decision’ or ‘appropriate safeguards’ – for example, reliance on your explicit consent to that transfer.

If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact us as set forth in “Contact Us” below. We will process such requests in accordance with applicable laws.

## 11. CHILDREN’S INFORMATION
The Services are not directed to children under 18 (or other age as required by local law), and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

If we become aware that a child has provided us with personal information in violation of applicable law, we will delete any personal information we have collected, unless we have a legal obligation to keep it, and terminate the child’s account if applicable.

## 12. OTHER PROVISIONS

If there are any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you as required by applicable law.

**Refer-a-Friend and Similar Incentive Programs.** As described above in “How We Use Your Personal Information”, we may offer referral programs or other incentivized data collection programs. For example, we may offer incentives to you such as discounts or promotional items or credit in connection with these programs, wherein you provide your personal information in exchange for a reward, or provide personal information regarding your friends or colleagues (such as their email address) and receive rewards when they sign up to use our Services.
